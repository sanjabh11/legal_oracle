Here are three test scenarios for each core feature, plus the location of your LLM system prompt documentation.

Test Scenarios
1. Outcome Prediction
Scenario 1: Standard Case Prediction

Input: Contract dispute, California, clear list of key facts, no judge info.
Expected: Returns win/settle/lose probabilities, LLM explanation is present, no fallback flag.
Scenario 2: Missing/Invalid LLM Output (Fallback)

Input: Unusual case type or malformed facts that trigger an LLM parse error.
Expected: Returns fallback probabilities, fallback explanation is shown, isLLMFallback is true, UI shows fallback warning.
Scenario 3: Judge-Specific Prediction

Input: Personal injury, New York, key facts, judge name provided.
Expected: LLM incorporates judge info in explanation, probabilities reflect judge's historical tendencies.
2. CaseLaw AI

Expected: Returns at least one relevant Hugging Face and one CourtListener opinion card.
Scenario 2: No Results Found

Input: Query “Quantum banana doctrine”, jurisdiction “Wyoming”.
Expected: UI displays “No results yet” or “No opinions found”, no error.
Scenario 3: API Failure Handling

Simulate backend API down.
Expected: UI shows error message, does not crash, can retry.
3. Strategy Optimization
Scenario 1: Optimize for Strong Case

Input: Case with clear facts and viable initial strategy.
Expected: Returns a list of recommended strategies, each with description and success rate.
Scenario 2: Incomplete Case Details

Input: Missing key facts or strategy.
Expected: LLM asks for clarification or returns fallback strategies, UI displays a warning or prompt.
Scenario 3: Invalid LLM Output

Simulate LLM returning malformed JSON.

Scenario 1: Standard Forecast

Input: Industry “Tech”, jurisdiction “California”, time horizon “2 years”.
Expected: Returns predicted regulatory changes and impact analysis.
Scenario 2: Missing Industry or Jurisdiction

Input: Only time horizon provided.
Expected: LLM asks for clarification or returns fallback forecast, UI shows warning.
Scenario 3: LLM/API Failure

Simulate LLM or API error.
Expected: Returns fallback regulatory forecast, UI shows fallback warning.
5. Arbitrage Alerts
Scenario 1: User With Clear Interests

Now have a careful and detailed look again at the entire conversation, users stories and codebase to fully audit the website created,

Find out the gaps with functionality using using ALL the gap analysis done earlier and subsequent implementations.
Find out the gaps in API implementation with user stories a .
Please proceed with start implementing the high and medium priority gaps immediately. ensure that once you complete, pls list the pending feature, if any to be implemented with the details with “remaining features”
