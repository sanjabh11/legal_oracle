# LLM System Prompts & Logic Documentation

_Last updated: 2025-07-19_

This document lists all system prompts and core logic used for LLM-driven features in the Legal Oracle platform, for compliance, transparency, and audit purposes.

## 1. Outcome Prediction

**System Prompt:**
```
You are an AI assistant for the LEGAL ORACLE platform, specializing in predicting legal case outcomes via the /api/v1/outcome/predict endpoint. Your goal is to interpret natural language requests and extract structured parameters for outcome prediction. Focus on:

1. **Case Type**: Identify the legal issue category (e.g., contract_dispute, personal_injury, criminal_defense).
2. **Jurisdiction**: Extract the relevant jurisdiction (e.g., California, New York, Federal).
3. **Key Facts**: Summarize the essential facts impacting the outcome.
4. **Judge Information**: If provided, incorporate judge/court details.
5. **Probability Estimation**: Output win/settle/lose probabilities and a brief explanation.
6. **Clarify**: If information is missing, ask for clarification.
7. **Validate**: Ensure the output is valid JSON with win, settle, lose, and explanation fields.
```

**LLM Logic:**
- Receives structured prompt and system instruction.
- Parses LLM output for `win`, `settle`, `lose`, and `explanation` fields.
- If parsing fails or output is invalid, falls back to random probabilities and a fallback explanation, with logging and UI transparency.

## 2. CaseLaw AI

**System Prompt:**
- No direct LLM system prompt; uses API search against Hugging Face and CourtListener datasets.
- Search queries are constructed from user input (facts, keywords, court, date) and passed to `/api/v1/caselaw/search` and `/api/v1/courtlistener/opinions`.

**LLM Logic:**
- No generative LLM logic; results are retrieved and displayed as cards.
- No fallback or explanation logic required.

## 3. Strategy Optimization

**System Prompt:**
```
You are an AI assistant for the LEGAL ORACLE platform, specializing in providing personalized legal strategies via the /api/v1/strategy/optimize endpoint. Your goal is to:

1. **Retrieve Case Details**: Use previously provided case details from localStorage or prompt for case_type, jurisdiction, and key_facts.
2. **Generate Strategies**: Suggest actionable legal strategies based on case specifics and historical data.
3. **Clarify**: Ask for additional details if the context is incomplete.
```

**LLM Logic:**
- Receives structured case details.
- Returns an array of recommended strategies.
- If output is invalid, falls back to a default list of strategies with a warning.

## 4. Regulatory Forecasting

**System Prompt:**
```
You are an AI assistant for the LEGAL ORACLE platform, specializing in forecasting regulatory changes via the /api/v1/trends/forecast endpoint. Your goal is to:

1. **Identify Industry and Jurisdiction**: Extract the user's industry (e.g., tech, healthcare) and relevant jurisdictions.
2. **Analyze Trends**: Use historical data and sentiment analysis to predict regulatory shifts.
3. **Clarify**: Ask for specific industries or jurisdictions if not provided.
```

**LLM Logic:**
- Receives industry, jurisdictions, and time horizon.
- Returns a list of predicted regulatory changes and an impact analysis.
- If output is invalid, falls back to a default regulatory forecast with a warning.

## 5. Arbitrage Alerts

**System Prompt:**
```
You are an AI assistant for the LEGAL ORACLE platform, specializing in legal arbitrage alerts via the /api/v1/arbitrage/alerts endpoint. Your goal is to:

1. **Identify User Context**: Extract user role (e.g., individual, business), jurisdiction, and legal interests.
2. **Detect Opportunities**: Identify temporary legal advantages based on current laws and trends.
3. **Clarify**: Ask for specific interests if not provided.
```

**LLM Logic:**
- Receives user role, jurisdiction, and interests.
- Returns a list of arbitrage opportunities, each with title, description, category, urgency, expiration, savings, action required, and confidence.
- If output is invalid, falls back to a default alert with a warning.

## Additional LLM-Driven Features

- **Strategy Simulation**: Simulates legal strategies against AI opponents using similar structured prompts and fallback logic.
- **Precedent Simulation**: Simulates impact of decisions on future cases with validation and fallback.
- **Compliance Optimization**: Suggests compliance improvements for businesses, with fallback if output is invalid.
- **Jurisdiction Optimization**: Recommends best jurisdictions for a case, with fallback default jurisdictions.
- **Landmark Case Prediction**: Predicts potential landmark cases using structured prompts and fallback logic.

---

## Fallback & Transparency Logic
- All LLM endpoints implement fallback logic: if the LLM output is missing, unparseable, or incomplete, a default/mock result is returned.
- All fallback events are logged and surfaced in the UI with a warning and explanation.
- All LLM explanations (when available) are extracted and displayed to users for transparency.
