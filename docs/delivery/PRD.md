# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Legal Oracle AI Platform

## Overview
Legal Oracle is a production-ready, AI-powered legal intelligence platform that predicts legal outcomes, forecasts regulatory trends, simulates precedent impacts, optimizes legal strategies, and provides actionable insights for legal professionals, businesses, and individuals.

## Problem Statement
Legal professionals and individuals face uncertainty in case outcomes, regulatory changes, and compliance. There is a need for a unified platform that leverages AI to deliver predictive analytics, strategy optimization, and actionable legal intelligence with robust security and production reliability.

## User Stories
- As a lawyer, I want to predict case outcomes and optimize my strategy for the highest chance of success.
- As a business, I want to forecast regulatory changes and receive compliance recommendations.
- As an individual, I want to receive legal guidance and alerts for opportunities or risks.
- As a researcher, I want to analyze legal trends and landmark case predictions.
- As a judge or scholar, I want to simulate precedent impacts and jurisdictional outcomes.

## Technical Approach
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, glassmorphism UI, LocalStorage caching, responsive/mobile-first
- **Backend**: Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage), FastAPI (Caselaw Service), Google Gemini LLM, robust error handling
- **Security**: Environment-based secrets, dependency audits, JWT handling, no hardcoded secrets, pip-audit/npm audit
- **Testing**: Full backend (pytest) and frontend (vitest) test coverage, CI pipeline enforces passing tests for deployment
- **OpenAPI**: All endpoints and models documented and validated, spec synced with implementation

## UX/UI Considerations
- Premium, glassmorphism hero section and landing page
- Mobile-first, responsive design
- White serif fonts, modern spacing, smooth transitions, fade-in/fade-out
- Clear visual hierarchy and accessible navigation

## Acceptance Criteria
- All endpoints implemented, tested, and documented in OpenAPI spec
- Full test coverage for backend and frontend; CI/CD pipeline passes
- No critical dependency vulnerabilities (npm audit, pip-audit)
- LocalStorage caching and invalidation logic verified for dashboard and alerts
- No hardcoded secrets; all secrets managed via environment variables
- Production deployment instructions and documentation complete

## Dependencies
- Supabase, Google Gemini API, FastAPI, React, Tailwind CSS, Vitest, Pytest

## Open Questions
- Ongoing: How to further automate legal research and integrate with external legal databases?
- What additional user roles or premium features should be prioritized next?
