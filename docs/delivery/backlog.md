| PBI-100 | User | As a legal AI platform owner, I want streaming wrappers and endpoints for seven large legal datasets so that my application can query them efficiently without loading entire corpora into memory. | Agreed | 1. All seven datasets accessible via FastAPI streaming endpoints.<br>2. Shared utilities abstract common logic.<br>3. Automated tests pass for every dataset.<br>4. Documentation updated in `docs/technical/more-legal-datasets.md`.<br>5. CI passes with new tests and linting. |
