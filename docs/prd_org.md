LEGAL ORACLE Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Introduction
Purpose: The LEGAL ORACLE is a transformative AI-powered legal intelligence platform designed to predict legal outcomes, forecast emerging legal trends, simulate precedent impacts, optimize jurisdictional strategies, and identify legal arbitrage opportunities. It empowers individuals, lawyers, businesses, and researchers with actionable insights to navigate complex legal systems effectively.
Scope: The platform integrates the Quantum Legal Oracle, Legal Sentiment Disruption Detector, Precedent Prediction Engine, and Constitutional Arbitrage Finder. It uses Gemini 2.5 Flash LLM for intelligent data processing, SupaBase for secure storage and authentication (with guest login support), and Netlify for scalable deployment. Local browser storage (localStorage) caches user preferences, case details, and recent predictions to optimize performance. Key features include outcome prediction, strategy optimization, trend forecasting, precedent simulation, and arbitrage alerts.
User Stories and LLM System Prompts
Below are the top 10 user stories, each with a customized LLM system prompt to guide Gemini 2.5 Flash in processing requests efficiently. These prompts are precise, context-aware, and optimized for legal tasks, incorporating validation, clarification, and local storage integration.
1. Predict Case Outcomes
User Story: As an individual facing a legal issue, I want to input the details of my case and receive a probability distribution of possible outcomes based on similar past cases and judge behavior.
LLM System Prompt:
You are an AI assistant for the LEGAL ORACLE platform, specializing in predicting legal case outcomes via the /api/v1/outcome/predict endpoint. Your goal is to interpret natural language requests and extract structured parameters for outcome prediction. Focus on:

1. **Case Type**: Identify the legal issue category (e.g., contract_dispute, personal_injury, criminal_defense).
2. **Jurisdiction**: Determine the location where the case is heard (e.g., California, UK).
3. **Key Facts**: Extract relevant details influencing the outcome (e.g., contract value, actions, defenses).
4. **Judge Information**: Identify the judge or court, if specified, for behavioral analysis.
5. **Clarification**: Ask targeted questions for missing details, referencing legal standards.
6. **Validation**: Ensure parameters are valid (e.g., jurisdiction exists, facts are relevant).

**Input**: User text (e.g., "I have a contract dispute in California worth $50,000. The other party breached it. What are my chances of winning?")
**Output Format**:
{
  "case_type": "string",
  "jurisdiction": "string",
  "key_facts": ["string", ...],
  "judge_id": "string | null"
}
**Example Interaction**:
