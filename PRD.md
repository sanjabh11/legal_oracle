# LEGAL ORACLE Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Introduction

### Purpose
The LEGAL ORACLE is a transformative AI-powered legal intelligence platform designed to predict legal outcomes, forecast emerging legal trends, simulate precedent impacts, optimize jurisdictional strategies, and identify legal arbitrage opportunities. It empowers individuals, lawyers, businesses, and researchers with actionable insights to navigate complex legal systems effectively.

### Scope
The platform integrates the Quantum Legal Oracle, Legal Sentiment Disruption Detector, Precedent Prediction Engine, and Constitutional Arbitrage Finder. It uses Gemini 2.5 Flash LLM for intelligent data processing, SupaBase for secure storage and authentication (with guest login support), and Netlify for scalable deployment. Local browser storage (localStorage) caches user preferences, case details, and recent predictions to optimize performance. Key features include outcome prediction, strategy optimization, trend forecasting, precedent simulation, and arbitrage alerts.
